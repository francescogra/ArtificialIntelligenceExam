# Metaheuristic Algorithms for Image Reconstruction: Tabu search and Iterated Local Search

# Project Overview:
In this project, I explored the application of two popular metaheuristic algorithms—Tabu Search (TS) and Iterated Local Search (ILS)—for image reconstruction using transparent polygons. The goal was to reconstruct a famous painting by overlapping semitransparent polygons and optimizing the image similarity using Python libraries like Pillow, scikit-image, and OpenCV.

# Key Components:
1. Image Processing in Python:
  Utilized libraries such as Pillow, scikit-image, and OpenCV for handling image data.
  Programmatically generated images from polygons with varying colors and transparency.

2. Metaheuristic Optimization:
  Implemented Tabu Search (TS) and Iterated Local Search (ILS) to iteratively reconstruct an image by adjusting the polygon parameters.
  Developed a fitness function to minimize the difference between the generated image and the reference image using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
  
3. Performance Evaluation:
  Compared the performance of both algorithms based on their ability to accurately replicate a famous painting.
  Visualized the evolution of the image reconstruction through side-by-side comparisons at various stages of the algorithm's execution.

# Skills and Technologies Used:
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pillow, scikit-image, OpenCV.
Algorithms: Tabu Search, Iterated Local Search.
Image Comparison Techniques: MSE, SSIM for similarity measurement.

# Outcome: 
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of metaheuristic algorithms in image reconstruction tasks, offering insights into optimization techniques and image processing. This work showcases my ability to combine machine learning with computational optimization for creative problem-solving in AI-driven image analysis.
